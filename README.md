**Predicting the Sanremo 2025 Winner for Home Viewers Using Real-Time Twitter Sentiment Analysis**

## üìä Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for **Sanremo Forecasting**, a machine learning project aimed at **predicting the televote winner** of Italy's 
**Sanremo Music Festival 2025** by performing **real-time sentiment analysis** on Twitter (X.com) posts. The core idea is to scrape tweets about each artist during the live broadcast, classify their sentiment (positive or negative), and use an LSTM-based model to forecast which artist will top the public televote.
